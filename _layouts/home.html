    Thanks for visiting! I am an evolutionary biologist passionate about understanding how and why diverse behaviors evolve in nature. I'm currently a <a href="https://www.nyas.org/person/yuki-haba/">Leon Levy Scholar in Neurosceince</a> at Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. I work with <a href="https://www.abdus-saboorlab.com/people/">Ishmail Abdus-Saboor</a> to study genetic and neuronal mechanisms underlying social behaviors in the African naked mole-rat. I aim to take multi-desciplinary approaches, combining genomics, neuroscience, and field-based behavioral ecology to comprehensively understand the evolution of behavior.

    I completed my Ph.D. at Princeton University, working with <a href="https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/">Lindy McBride</a> on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222001245">the evolution of a human-biting mosquito, <em>Culex pipiens</em></a>. I spearheaded the <em>Culex <u>pip</u>iens</em></a> <u>pop</u>ulation genomics project (nicknamed <a href="https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/pippop/">PipPop</a>), collaborating with 200+ amazing mosquito researchers worldwide to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.26.634793">uncover the enigmatic origin of the "London Underground mosquito"</a>.

    I earned my Master's at Columbia University where I truly fell in love with evolutionary biology and genomics. I worked with <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~dr2497/">Dustin Rubenstein</a> and <a href="https://www.biodiv.tw/pi-Sheng-Feng_Shen">Sheng-Feng Shen</a> for my MA thesis on adaptive behavioral variation in a burying beetle. I was also fortunate enough to be in the lab of <a href="https://przeworskilab.com/">Molly Przeworski</a>, working with <a href="https://schumerlab.com/">Molly Schumer</a> (now at Stanford) and Zack Baker to study <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24133">the evolution of recombination hotspots</a>.

    Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, I graduated from the University of Tokyo for my undergraduate degree where I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AU3PKTsAAAAJ&hl=en">Nobuyuki Kutsukake</a> at SOKENDAI on <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10682-019-10011-6">the evolution of (eu)sociality</a> in the naked mole rat and other African rodents.

    I spent most of my youth chasing soccer balls, savoring ramen, and playing Nintendo games. Since moving to NYC for grad school, I've found a new passion for beautiful jazz and flavorful coffee.
